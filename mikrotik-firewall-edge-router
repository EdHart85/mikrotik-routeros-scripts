# MIKROTIK ROUTEROS FIREWALL SCRIPT FOR EDGE ROUTERS (BGP) - IPv4

# Adapted by Eduardo Hartmann (https://github.com/EdHart85) from the AMAZING work done by Daryll Swer at https://www.daryllswer.com/edge-router-bng-optimisation-guide-for-isps/
# I strongly advise you to read Daryll's material as he constantly updates it. Also, it has a lot more than firewall configuration tips that migth be very useful in many scenarios.
# Tested only on RouterOS version 7.x.

# To better understand this script, please consider the following:
# 192.0.2.0/24 - Fictional network owned by this AS
# PEER-1 - Network interface with BGP peer 1 - IP address: 203.0.113.1/24
# PEER-2 - Network interface with BGP peer 2 - IP address: 233.252.0.1/24
# LAN-1 - LAN network interface 1 - IP address: 192.0.2.1/25
# LAN-2 - LAN network interface 2 - IP address: 192.0.2.129/25
# Peer 1 IP address: 203.0.113.2
# Peer 2 IP address: 233.252.0.2
# Network administrator IP address: 192.0.2.2
# lan_subnets: List of subnets owned by this AS
# not_in_internet: List of subnets that should not be seen on Internet and, therefore, must be discarded
# bad_ipv4: List of others reserver subnets that should not be seen on Internet and, therefore, must also be discarded
# whitelist: List of host/subnets that the router will be allowed to communicate with (BGP peers, DNS servers, etc)
# router_addresses: List of all router's addresses, including both internal and external interfaces


# We will use the RAW firewall table, which consumes very little CPU. That means no NAT, no packet marking and other fancy features but we won't need them on the edge router.
# More importantly, it means NO CONNECTION TRACKING. Thus, this router will have a stateless firewall which translates into less CPU usage, faster network routing and robustness against DOS attacks.
/ip firewall connection tracking set enabled=no
